# Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description


The Weekend Movie Sagas is an application that is able to list out specific movies and their corresponding details. It gives you the ability to add a movie if you would like- updating the list after you have saved the movie. 

I created the form that allows you to add a movie, along with the routes that make it possible. I also created routes that enable you to click on the movie and be taken to a page that list the details of that movie. 


### Prerequisites


Node.js
Axios
React
Redux
Postgresql

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `table.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
